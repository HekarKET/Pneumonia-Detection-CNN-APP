# Pneumonia Detection using CNN



## A CNN model which can predict Pneumonia using Chest X-ray

This project contains a CNN architecture (inspired by vgg16). 
We trained our model on 5216 training examples and 16 examples as validation dataset. Applied Data augmentation and by   
customizing the Class weights model was able to classify Chest X-ray with 90% accuracy.
